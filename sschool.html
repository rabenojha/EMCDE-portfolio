                    <p>I first came to know about the Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G) conference when I was
                        doing my undergrad back in Nepal. So, I have been following it for a few years now. As I moved
                        to Europe last year to attend graduate school and FOSS4G 2022 and State of the Map 2022 were
                        happening in Italy, I was really looking forward to both conferences. </p>

                                    and 193 online attending the conference.</p>
                                <p>The 3 days were full of talks, workshops, posters, academic tracks related to OSM
                                    mapping, new tools and technologies developed around OSM, research and findings
                                    based on the data, works of the local communities in their regions, etc. And not to

                                    <p>Learnt the basic introduction to SQL and PostgreSQL, the possibilities of using
                                        SQL instead of some Desktop GIS’s functionalities, storing and using geospatial

                                        Luckily, after some days, I got an email confirmation from the organizers saying
                                        that I
                                        was one of the recipients of the travel grant. </p>

                                        President and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University
                                        of Iceland. During the first day, there were talks about ESA's Quantum Computing
                                        Initiative, an introduction to the Destination Earth project and a hands on
                                        session with Microsoft Planetary Computer. Not to forget, we also had a nice
                                        social dinner in the evening. </p>

                                    <p>On the 2nd day, we learned about how the stencil computation is applied to
                                        preprocess hyperspectral images on shared memory systems. Álvaro Ordóñez
                                        Iglesias from the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela talked about
                                        registration of multi spectral and hyperspectral images on HPCs. There was also
                                        another interesting talk about CoE RAISE project and how they have been
                                        developing AI methods toward exascale computation. </p>

                                    <p>The 3rd day included presentations from Dr Raúl Guerra about the use of parallel

                                        applications integrated with low-power NVIDIA GPUs. In another session, Alison
                                        Lowndes from NVIDIA talked about how they have been improving the gaming sector
                                        with AI technology. All the sessions on the last day were about quantum
                                        computing. Prof. Piotr Gawron and Aleksandra Krawiec talked about the principles
                                        of quantum computing, different models of it, and how quantum computing is being
                                        used for earth observations. </p><br>
